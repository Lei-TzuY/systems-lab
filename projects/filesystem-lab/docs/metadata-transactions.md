# Cross-table metadata transactions

Filesystem format v5 persists allocation, inode, and directory metadata in separate checksummed home regions, but lifecycle changes often need several regions to advance together. Creating a reachable file that immediately owns a data block is the smallest three-table example: allocation ownership, the inode block reference, and the namespace entry must describe the same committed state.

## Inode + directory transactions

`metadata_tx::store_inode_directory_tables_journaled` renders the desired inode-table and directory-table snapshots first, computes the changed home blocks across both regions, and places that complete write set into one existing WAL transaction. The durability sequence is:

1. render and validate both desired table images without touching home locations;
2. read the current durable inode and directory regions and retain only changed blocks;
3. encode one journal transaction containing every changed home block;
4. write the bounded journal image and flush it;
5. replay the committed transaction to inode/directory home locations;
6. flush the home-location writes.

A crash before the commit record is durable changes neither table. A crash after commit may leave a prefix of home writes visible, including an inode-table update without its directory-table partner, but the durable journal remains authoritative. Recovery replays the complete transaction idempotently and restores the intended cross-table state.

## Allocation + inode + directory create transactions

`create_tx::store_create_metadata_journaled` extends the same mechanism across the durable allocation bitmap, inode table, and directory table. It is intended for bounded create/link lifecycle steps where a newly allocated data block must become owned by a reachable inode in the same commit.

The desired allocator image and both metadata-table images are rendered into one capture device. Only changed blocks from the allocation, inode, and directory regions are retained. Those blocks are then framed by one Begin/Commit pair and published as one WAL transaction. The transaction is never split across commits.

For the common single-block case this prevents three inconsistent crash states from being accepted as complete operations:

- allocated-but-unreferenced data ownership;
- an inode referencing a block whose allocation bit is not durable;
- a directory entry targeting an inode whose durable lifecycle state has not advanced with it.

A crash after commit can still expose a prefix of home writes temporarily. For example, allocation and inode home blocks may be visible while the directory-table home write fails. That intermediate state is not considered complete; the committed WAL remains authoritative, and recovery must replay all home writes before fsck is expected to accept the namespace again.

## Validated unlink transitions

`unlink_tx::store_unlink_metadata_journaled` reuses the same three-table WAL engine, but it first validates the requested post-unlink snapshots against the currently durable home metadata. Atomicity alone is not enough: without semantic validation, a caller could atomically persist a dangling namespace, leak a block, free a block still referenced elsewhere, or delete a directory that still contains children.

The current unlink primitive is deliberately narrow. Before any new journal image is published, it requires exactly one namespace entry and exactly its target inode to disappear. The root inode cannot be removed. Surviving inode records and namespace entries must remain byte-for-byte semantically unchanged, and the removed inode may have only that one durable namespace reference. A directory target must be empty before removal.

Allocator transition validation is equally strict: no new data block may become allocated, and the set of blocks changing from owned to free must equal the removed inode's complete persisted block list. This rejects partial release, unrelated release, and allocation side effects before they can cross the WAL durability boundary.

Hard links, orphan handling, and recursive removal are intentionally rejected rather than approximated. Those semantics need independent lifecycle contracts before they can safely share this primitive.

## Validated rename transitions

`rename_tx::rename_entry_journaled` defines the first bounded rename contract. It changes exactly one durable namespace key while preserving the target inode and leaving allocation and inode metadata untouched. The source `(parent, name)` must exist, both source and destination parents must be durable directory inodes, and the destination `(parent, name)` must be unused. Overwrite and exchange rename semantics are intentionally not approximated.

The root inode cannot be moved. When the target is itself a directory, the destination parent must not be that directory or any inode reachable below it through the current namespace graph after removing the source edge. This rejects directory-cycle creation before a new journal image is published. Invalid destination component names are rejected by the same `DNT1` entry codec used for durable directory records.

Persistence reuses the existing directory-table WAL primitive. The complete post-rename namespace snapshot is rendered before publication, changed directory-table blocks are placed in one transaction, the journal commit is flushed first, and recovery writes the new namespace home. A crash before commit preserves the old name. A crash after commit but before the home write completes leaves the old home snapshot visible while the committed journal remains authoritative; replay installs the new name idempotently. There is no state in which a successful recovery accepts neither the old key nor the new key.

## Bounded capacity

Journal records contain full 4 KiB home blocks. Transactions are never split merely to fit the reservation. If the complete changed-block set and begin/commit framing exceed the journal region, the operation returns `InvalidInput` before publishing a new journal image.

With the current record and region codecs, a transaction containing two full-block writes needs three 4 KiB journal blocks, while a common allocation+inode+directory create changes three home blocks and therefore needs four journal blocks. Newly formatted v5 filesystems reserve four journal blocks by default so the three-table atomic-create and atomic-unlink primitives are usable with ordinary `format_device()` geometry. Explicit smaller geometries remain supported for tests and constrained images; an explicit three-block journal must still reject a three-home-block transaction atomically rather than splitting the transaction.

Journal geometry is explicit in the v5 superblock, so this formatter-policy change does not reinterpret existing v5 images. A previously formatted image that persisted a three-block journal continues to use that capacity when reopened.

## Invariants exercised

Focused deterministic regressions verify that:

- a valid inode+directory update commits as exactly one transaction;
- an identical pair of inode/directory snapshots is a no-op;
- an uncommitted cross-table transaction mutates neither home table;
- failure on the second inode/directory home write leaves a durable transaction that recovery can replay;
- repeated recovery is idempotent;
- a too-small journal reservation rejects the combined update before home metadata changes;
- the default formatter provisions enough journal space for the common allocation+inode+directory create transaction;
- a three-table create commits allocation ownership, inode references, and namespace publication as exactly one transaction;
- failure on the directory home write after allocation and inode home writes is repaired by replay of the same committed three-table transaction;
- an explicit three-block journal rejects a three-home-block create before any home metadata changes;
- atomic unlink removes namespace, inode, and block ownership together;
- a committed unlink interrupted between home writes is repaired by idempotent recovery;
- unlink validation rejects a target that remains referenced, unrelated block release, and non-empty directory removal before WAL publication;
- a valid rename replaces exactly one namespace key while retaining the target inode;
- rename rejects destination overwrite and directory moves into descendants before WAL publication;
- a committed rename interrupted before its directory home write preserves the old home snapshot until recovery installs the new snapshot, and repeated recovery is idempotent;
- after successful recovery, read-only fsck accepts allocation ownership, inode references, root reachability, and namespace relationships.

These primitives intentionally do not yet define overwrite/exchange rename, hard-link counts, orphan handling, recursive removal, data-block contents, or broad POSIX behavior. Those require their own bounded lifecycle transactions and invariants.
